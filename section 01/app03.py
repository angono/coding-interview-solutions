# data types in python 

# 1) numbers have integer and floating point.
# an integer does not have decimals. x is an integer
x = 12
print (x)

# a floating point number has decimals. y is a floating point number
y = 12.4
print(y)

# 2) strings
# strings are simply text. they are surrounded by single or double quotes
# using single quotes
print('this is in single quotes')

# using double quotes
print('this is in double quotes')

# 3) booleans 
# boolean data type can only have one of these two values: True or False
bool_value_true = True
print(bool_value_true)

bool_value_false = False
print(bool_value_false)

# comparing some numbers and see whether the expression evaluates to True or False
print('10 > 4 is ',10 > 4)
print('7 > 3 is ',7 > 3)
print('4 < 1 is ',4 < 1)
print('10 == 10 is ',10 == 10)
print('8 == 5 is ',8 == 5)


# 4) list
#  a list is an order collection of data
# it can contain strings, numbers, etc
# lists are written with square brackets []
# the values or elements in a list are separated with commas ','

mylist1 = ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four']
print(mylist1)


mylist2 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(mylist2)

mylist3 = [10, 20, 30, 'first', 'secont', 'third']
print(mylist3)
