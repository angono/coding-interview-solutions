HERE IS THE LIST OF MY STUDIES PLAN

Preparing for a data structures and algorithms interview within a two-week timeframe can be challenging, but with a focused and efficient study plan, you can make significant progress. Here's a comprehensive outline to help you prepare effectively:


Week 1: Understanding Core Concepts
	Day 1-3: Python Basics and Time Complexity
		Examples:
			- Brush up on basic Python syntax and concepts.
			- Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a given number.
			- Implement a function to check if a given string is a palindrome.
			- Write a function to find the nth Fibonacci number using recursion and dynamic programming.

		Exercises:
			- Given an array of integers, find the maximum and minimum elements.
			- Given two strings, check if one is a permutation of the other.
			- Write a function to compute the power of a number using recursion. 

		Exercises:
			Arrays:
				- Find the second largest element in an array.
				- Given an array of integers, remove all duplicates and return the new array.

			Strings:
				- Reverse words in a sentence ("Hello World" -> "World Hello").
				- Count the occurrences of each character in a string.

			Time Complexity:
				- Analyze the time complexity of your solutions in the examples and exercises.


	Day 4-5: Arrays and Strings
		Examples:
			- Given an array of integers, find the two elements that sum up to a given target.
			- Reverse a string in-place.
			- Check if a string has all unique characters.

		Exercises:
			- Given an array of integers, find the subarray with the largest sum (Kadane's algorithm).
			- Rotate a matrix (2D array) 90 degrees clockwise.

		Exercises:
			Strings:
				- Check if two strings are anagrams.
				- Check if a string is a rotation of another string ("abcde" and "deabc" are rotations).

			Arrays:
				- Given a sorted array, find the index of a target element using binary search.
				- Rotate an array to the right by k steps.
